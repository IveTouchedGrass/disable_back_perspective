# Disable Back Perspective

A client-side Minecraft mod for Fabric 1.21.1 that **disables the back perspective** (the camera facing the back of the player's head). This can be toggled with a keybind.

## Installation

1. Install **Fabric Loader 1.21.1**.  
2. Place the mod `.jar` in your `mods` folder, alongside **Fabric API**.  
3. Launch Minecraft with Fabric for 1.21.1.

## Usage

- The mod is **active by default**, meaning you can only switch between **first-person** and **third-person front** perspectives using Vanilla's "Toggle Perspective" keybind.  
- You can toggle the mod on or off with a keybind (default: `\`).  
- The keybind can be changed in Minecraft's **Controls → Keybinds** settings.

## Notes

- **Client-side only** — safe to join any server (vanilla, modded, Paper, etc.).  
- Works in both singleplayer and multiplayer.
